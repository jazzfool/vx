# vx

## Yet another GUI experiment of mine

## Goals

- No `Rc<RefCell<..>>` whatsoever.
- No inherently `unsafe` code whatsoever.
- No non-trivial or non-derive macros whatsoever.

In essence, `vx` aims to be written in only the most _pure_ form of Rust. No interior mutability, 100% safety, and no macros.
